		<description>This is a wonderful binding; it&#039;s lightweight but effective. However, I cannot get it work with two dimensional data arrays such as this.

  function users(one, two three){
    this.one = ko.observable(one);
    this.two = ko.observable(two); 
    this.three = ko.observable(three);
  }

I&#039;m sure I&#039;m simply failing to grasp the paradigm, but I&#039;d give a lot for a simple example of column population by key instead of index.</description>

		<description>Heya Josh,

Your blog post inspired me to create a pretty fully featured databinding in knockout js that integrates with datatables.  If you&#039;re interested you can check it out at: https://github.com/CogShift/Knockout.Extensions

With a demo&#039;s at: http://jsfiddle.net/ducka/fPaQs/ and http://jsfiddle.net/ducka/haq2y/

Cheers!</description>

		<description>Its not so much of a complete regen as a rearrangement. The elements in the TBODY that can be reused are (i.e. the TR elements are held in a Javascript variable and appended to the table&#039;s body as required). As such, any static events or properties assigned to the nodes are retained, since it isn&#039;t actually creating a new node (unless of course you are adding a new row).</description>

		<description>Hi Niklas,

Sorry about the delay in replying!

You should be able to supply any data that is accepted by DataTables&#039; fnAddData() method (see http://datatables.net/api). It states that you can supply either Arrays or Objects - I&#039;ve just had a quick try with objects but the table wouldn&#039;t render, not sure why though. 

Maybe you&#039;ll be able to find something useful on the API page above. If you do, let me know!</description>

		<description>Hi Orson,

The paging doesn&#039;t appear on my demo as I&#039;ve only styled the table - not the entire datatable. If I had referenced the full datatables CSS, the Prev/Next buttons would be visible. 

To check this, you can use Firebug to inspect the generated table. There will be 2 DIVs in the same level as the table - one with a class &quot;dataTables_info&quot; which is the &quot;Showing 1 to 10 of...&quot; description, and another with a class &quot;dataTables_paginate paging_two_button&quot;. Inside this DIV are two more, which are the Prev/Next buttons. 

Hope that helps!</description>

		<description>Paging doesn&#039;t work without the &quot;bJQueryUI&quot; option activated. Is there a way i could have my paging working without the options set to true?</description>

		<description>Nice job!

I have a question about how we can data-bind to a object data model that looks like [{&quot;id&quot;:1, &quot;name&quot; : &quot;Josh&quot;}, {...}] instead of the example data model [&quot;data1&quot;, &quot;data2&quot;] ?</description>

		<description>I&#039;m very happy to see someone digging in to this.  When I was looking at data-binding frameworks, this was a big concern of mine; data binding looked great for many cases, but what about those where I&#039;m throwing a lot of things around with datatables?
I still haven&#039;t used Knockout in Real Life yet, but we&#039;re strongly considering it for some projects on the table right now, and seeing how this works will help.</description>

		<description>Yes, you’re correct, but unfortunately the table regen seems to be a limitation of DataTables itself - their own “Add Row” example shows the entire tbody being regenerated. If you inspect it in Firebug, then add a row, Firebug gives it a yellow highlight to indicate a dom change. (http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/api/add_row.html).

Glad you’ve found it useful though!</description>

		<description>Very nice to see this! I&#039;m a big fan of both declarative binding and DataTables, and I was just looking at Knockout. The only drawback I see to this plugin is that it appears that the entire table is regenerated for every change, rather than just adding/removing rows. Am I reading that correctly?

As someone just looking at Knockout, this was my first introduction to custom bindings, so this was a helpful example. Thanks!</description>
